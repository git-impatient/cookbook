## Instructions

Bring salted water to a boil in a large saucepan, add in the broccoli and let simmer for 8 minutes, until cooked through but not too soft.
Drain and set aside in the colander to finish draining.

Preheat the oven to 180°C (360°F). Grease a 20-cm (8-inch) cake pan.

In a medium mixing bowl, whisk together the cottage cheese, yogurt, eggs and oil, and sprinkle with salt and pepper.
In another medium mixing bowl, combine the cornmeal, flour and baking powder.
Fold the liquid ingredients into the dry ingredients until just combined; the batter will be thick. Do not overmix, it's fine if it's still a little lumpy.

Arrange the cooked broccoli at the bottom of the cake pan. Season with salt and pepper, and sprinkle with the walnuts and raisins. Pour the batter evenly over the broccoli, and smooth it out with a spatula.

Put into the oven to bake for 30 to 40 minutes, until the top is golden and lightly crusty.
Let rest on the counter for 5 minutes. Run a knife around the pan to loosen the cornmeal crust, cover the pan with a serving plate, and flip assertively (protect your hands with oven mitts of course) so the cake ends up broccoli side up on the plate.

Slice into wedges, using a sharp knife to avoid smooshing the broccoli. Serve warm, at room temperature or cold. Any leftovers can be reheated for 10 minutes in a hot oven if you wish to revive the crispness of the crust.
