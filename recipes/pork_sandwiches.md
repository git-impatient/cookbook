# Ingredients

### For the dry rub:
- 1 tablespoon brown sugar
- 1 tablespoon paprika
- 1 tablespoon chili powder
- 1 tablespoon garlic powder
- 1 tablespoon onion powder
- 1 teaspoon cayenne pepper
- 1 teaspoon black pepper
- 1 teaspoon salt

### For the pulled pork:
- 4-5 pounds pork shoulder (also known as pork butt or Boston butt)
- Dry rub mixture (from above)
- For the sweet and tangy sauce:
- 1 cup ketchup
- 1/4 cup apple cider vinegar
- 2 tablespoons Worcestershire sauce
- 2 tablespoons brown sugar
- 1 tablespoon Dijon mustard
- 1 tablespoon molasses
- 1 teaspoon smoked paprika
- 1 teaspoon garlic powder
- 1 teaspoon onion powder
- Salt and pepper to taste

# Preparation

* Preheat your oven to 300째F (150째C).

* In a small bowl, combine all the ingredients for the dry rub. Mix well.

* Pat the pork shoulder dry with paper towels. Then, generously rub the dry rub mixture all over the pork shoulder, making sure to cover all sides.

* Place the seasoned pork shoulder on a roasting rack set inside a roasting pan or a baking dish. Insert a meat thermometer into the thickest part of the meat, being careful not to touch the bone.

* Roast the pork shoulder in the preheated oven for approximately 6-7 hours or until the internal temperature reaches 195-205째F (90-96째C) and the meat is tender enough to be easily pulled apart with a fork.

* While the pork is cooking, prepare the sweet and tangy sauce. In a saucepan, combine all the sauce ingredients (ketchup, apple cider vinegar, Worcestershire sauce, brown sugar, Dijon mustard, molasses, smoked paprika, garlic powder, onion powder, salt, and pepper). Whisk together until well combined.

* Place the saucepan over medium heat and bring the mixture to a gentle simmer. Let it cook for about 10 minutes, stirring occasionally. Remove from heat and set aside.

* Once the pork shoulder is done, remove it from the oven and let it rest for about 15 minutes. This will allow the juices to redistribute and make the meat more flavorful.

* Using two forks or your hands, shred the pork shoulder into bite-sized pieces, discarding any excess fat or bones.

* Pour the sweet and tangy sauce over the shredded pork, reserving some for serving if desired. Mix well to coat the meat evenly.

* To serve, place a generous amount of pulled pork on a hamburger bun or sandwich roll. If desired, top with additional sauce and coleslaw for added flavor and texture.
