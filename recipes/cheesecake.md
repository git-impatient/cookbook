## Instructions:
Preheat the oven to 350 F / 180 C. Place the rack on the bottom third of the oven.
To make the pastry crust:
Place the butter, sugar and vanilla sugar in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment and mix until creamy. Add the egg and mix to combine. Add the flour, baking powder and salt and mix until it comes together in a dough. Alternatively, place everything in a food processor and pulse until the ingredients come together, then turn out onto the counter and knead to form a dough. Or place all the ingredients in a large mixing bowl and knead the mixture together with your hands until a dough forms.
Butter a 10 inch / 26cm springform. Press the dough onto the bottom and about an inch up the sides of the springform. It may initially appear like there isn't enough dough, but keep pressing it to form a thin, even layer throughout, making sure there are no cracks that could cause leakage. Chill in the fridge while you prepare the filling.
To make the filling:
Place the butter, sugar, vanilla sugar or extract, eggs, cornstarch and salt in a large mixing bowl and beat until smooth. Add the quark, sour cream, lemon zest and juice and beat until smooth. In a clean mixing bowl, beat the heavy whipping cream until stiff. Fold the whipped cream into the filling mixture until thoroughly combined.
Pour the filling into the crust and smooth over the surface. Bake for about an hour until the cheesecake has puffed up and is nicely browned on the top. The cheesecake should be quite firm to the touch but with a slight jiggle in the middle. Turn the oven off and leave the cheesecake inside with the oven door partially open (this will help prevent the top of the cake from splitting due to a sudden temperature change). Allow the cheesecake to fully cool before removing it from the springform and slicing, otherwise you run the risk of the cheesecake not being fully set.
Store your KÃ¤sekuchen in the fridge where it will keep for 3-4 days. For the best texture and flavor, let it come to room temperature before eating.
